# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/icons/
    - images/C1.png
    - images/C2.png
    - images/C3.png
    - images/C4.png
    - images/T11.png
    - images/T21.png
    - images/T31.png
    - images/T41.png
    - images/logo.png
    - images/des2.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Signika
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Signika-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: SignikaB
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Signika-Bold.ttf
    - family: SignikaL
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Signika-Light.ttf
    - family: SignikaM
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Signika-Medium.ttf
    - family: SignikaS
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Signika-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: SignikaR
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Signika-Regular.ttf
    - family: SignikaR
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Barlow-Regular.ttf
    - family: SignikaR
      fonts:

      fonts:

    # - family: Barlow-Bold
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: assets/fonts/Barlow-Bold.
    #       weight: 100
    #     - asset: fonts/Signika-Italic.ttf
    #       style: italic
    # - family: Trajan Pro
